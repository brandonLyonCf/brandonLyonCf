## About Me

Hybrid designer-developers are rare. I'm a self-taught developer. My university degree is in architecture and I minored in graphic design. I spend my free time reading professional journals to keep up to date on industry trends.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è I love design and development.
- üèÑ I've travelled the world but California is the only place that feels like home.
- üìñ I value knowledge.
- üç∑ Coffee, tea, or wine please.
- üïπÔ∏è Video games are my primary recreation.
- ü•è Sports aren't my thing but I do play frisbee golf.
- üå≤üêà I love plants and animals.
- üíª I'm platform agnostic. Arch, Debian, Mac, Windows, Chrome, Android, iOS, whatever.

### Myers-Briggs Personality type:

üîó[**‚ÄúThe Logician‚Äù**¬†(INTP)](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)

## How I think

- I operate in a judgement-free zone.
- I want you to feel comfortable around me. Please let me know if there is any way I can improve.
- The phrase "intent vs impact" is of high importance to me.
- I prefer the frank and direct approach and won't take it personally.
- I understand and empathize that others might not like the direct approach.
- I value self-sufficiency.
- I prefer long term thinking over short term thinking.
- I'm a fan of [the K.I.S.S principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
- I honor the 5 Ws. Who, what, when, where, and why? I love it when you ask those questions too.
- I prefer to plan rather than to improvise.
- Entropy & chaos will happen. Expect the unexpected.
- I'm somewhere in-between introvert and extrovert. Interacting with people can be exhausting but it's also enjoyable.
- Please help me document things! I have a good short term memory but a terrible long term memory.
- My background in architecture adds a unique behavioral psychology element to my designs.
- I want everyone to succeed. Please let me know if you feel you have been set up to fail.

## Working with me

I'm in the Pacific time zone and I'm not a morning person. That said, I'm happy to be accommodate your schedule. We're all in this together!

## How I learn

Everyone has a different learning style. I learn best by reading, doing, or actively conversing. I'm not an audible nor visual learner and I find videos to be distracting.

### Planning

If you add something to my sprint, then something else has to be removed. Lead time is usually measured in weeks and months, not days and hours. I understand that it's important to be flexible and pivot when appropriate but that shoud not be the norm.
